*****Accident data analysis*****

Overview:

This project aims to develop a comprehensive web-based system for police authorities to manage and analyze data related to accidents, incidents, and construction activities. The system provides functionalities for data visualization, modification, and predictive analytics using machine learning models. It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, Flask for the backend, and integrates with various data sources including databases and CSV files.

Features:

User Authentication: Secure login system to authenticate police authorities and grant access to authorized users.

Data Management: Allows police authorities to view, filter, and modify data from CSV files and databases, including accused data, victim data, accident data, and FIR details.

Machine Learning Integration: Utilizes trained machine learning models to predict the approximate number of accidents in a particular district for a selected year.

Construction Information: Provides information on ongoing construction activities on selected roads, enabling authorities to assess road conditions and plan accordingly.

Interactive Map: Integrates a map with a trained machine learning model to identify high-risk accident areas, aiding in targeted intervention and enforcement strategies.

Installation:
